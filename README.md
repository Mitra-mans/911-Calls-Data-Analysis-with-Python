# 🚔 911 Calls Data Analysis with Python

## 📌 Project Description
This project explores **911 emergency call data**, analyzing patterns in emergency responses across different categories such as fire, traffic, and medical incidents. The dataset is processed and visualized to extract meaningful insights, including call distribution over time, most frequent emergency types, and geographic patterns.

Through this analysis, we aim to understand **trends in emergency services**, which can help in resource allocation, predicting peak demand times, and improving response strategies.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from **[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania’s 911 Call Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert)**. It contains records of emergency calls, including:
- **Timestamp** (when the call was made)
- **Emergency type** (Fire, EMS, Traffic)
- **Latitude/Longitude** (for geospatial analysis)
- **Location** (city/town where the call originated)
- **Additional details** on emergency response
